## Project A02
#### Name: Michael Ellerkamp
#### Description: I am to do a presentation on OPENREFINE. I choose OpenRefine because I was already somewhat familiar with the tool due to having to deal with lots of student data in my previous job and I have only been using a fraction of its abilities. So I am looking forward to presenting a more robust picture of its powers.
